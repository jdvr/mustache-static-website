# mustache-static-website
A lightweight way to generate flexible static websites. Mustache and Node.

## How does it work?

Use _tpl_ folder to add _mustache_ templates and then use _generable-pages_ folder to declare with pages do you want to generate and relationship between templates.

This project is very simple and focus on the idea to provide just a structure to a static site project.
 
After setting all run:

```
npm generate
```

or

```
npm watch
```
